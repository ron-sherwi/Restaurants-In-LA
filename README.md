# Restaurants-In-LA
## Market Research - understand and describe the characteristics of restaurants in LA

- <b> Hey! I'm Ron Sherwi </b> , and my team consider to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles, so they’re interested in the current market conditions. 
- <b> My main goal is to understand and describe the characteristics of restaurants in LA </b>, based of:
  - Type of restaurants
  - Restaurant's street
  - Number of seats in a restaurant
  - Chain / not a chain of restaurants
- <b> I used data of thousands restaurants in LA during 2019. </b> There are many types of restaurants: cafe, fast food, bakery, Pizza, Bar and regular restaurants.
- <b> The project is divided to 3 parts:</b>
  - Data Preprocessing & EDA
  - Answer key questions
  - Conclusions and recommendations

- <b> The dataset `telecom_dataset_us.csv` </b> contains the following columns:

  - `object_name` — establishment name
  - `chain` — chain establishment (TRUE/FALSE)
  - `object_type` — call direction (`out` for outgoing, `in` for incoming)
  - `address` — address
  - `number` — number of seats
