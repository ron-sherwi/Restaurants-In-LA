# Restaurants-In-LA
## Market Research - understand and describe the characteristics of restaurants in LA

<b> Hey! I'm Ron Sherwi , and my team consider to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles, so theyâ€™re interested in the current market conditions. <b> 
My main goal is to understand and describe the characteristics of restaurants in LA, based of:
Type of restaurants
Restaurant's street
Number of seats in a restaurant
Chain / not a chain of restaurants
I used data of thousands restaurants in LA during 2019. There are many types of restaurants: cafe, fast food, bakery, Pizza, Bar and regular restaurants.
The project is divided to 3 parts:
Data Preprocessing & EDA
Answer key questions
Conclusions and recommendations
